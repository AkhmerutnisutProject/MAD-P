    <h2>Support our work</h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to support this project, you can help us by making a donation.  
      Even the smallest contributions help to preserve this important, yet rapidly deteriorating monument at Giza. For instance, with a donation of $25 we can pay a workman in our team a full day's wages, which is above the current minimum wage. Thank you! 
    </p>
