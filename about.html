    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>When thinking about ancient Egypt, one invariably thinks about pyramids. And when thinking about pyramids, one invariably thinks about the Giza Plateau. But the Giza necropolis was much more than a royal cemetery, an impression that likely escapes visitors due to most people’s focus on the royal monuments. The well-known pyramids, in the past, would have been surrounded by hundreds of elite tombs: many of these tombs were free-standing complexes, so-called mastabas, while others were carved in the rocky escarpments of the plateau. The Giza Plateau would have been a vibrant landscape, brought to life with people, rituals, and ceremonies extending beyond the pyramids to those surrounding elite tombs.
        Giza’s elite tombs are much lesser-known than the pyramids. However, they are as important as the pyramids for our understanding of ancient Egyptian history. In December 2023, the Mastaba of Akhmerutnisut Documentation Project (MAD-P) had its first season, funded by ARCE’s Antiquities Endowment Fund (AEF), with the kind permission of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Named after the tomb under study, MAD-P focuses on mastaba number G 2184, which belonged to the Fifth Dynasty official Akhmerutnisut.</p>
