    <h2>A Forgotten Tomb in Giza</h2>
    <p>When thinking about ancient Egypt, one invariably thinks about pyramids. And when thinking about pyramids, one invariably thinks about the Giza Plateau. But the Giza necropolis was much more than a royal cemetery, an impression that likely escapes visitors due to most people’s focus on the royal monuments. The well-known pyramids, in the past, would have been surrounded by hundreds of elite tombs: many of these tombs were free-standing complexes, so-called mastabas, while others were carved in the rocky escarpments of the plateau. The Giza Plateau would have been a vibrant landscape, brought to life with people, rituals, and ceremonies extending beyond the pyramids to those surrounding elite tombs.
        Giza’s elite tombs are much lesser-known than the pyramids. However, they are as important as the pyramids for our understanding of ancient Egyptian history.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Named after the tomb under study, the Mastaba of Akhmerutnisut Documentation Project (MAD-P) focuses on mastaba number G 2184, which belonged to the Fifth Dynasty official Akhmerutnisut. Akhmerutnisut’s mastaba, located on the northeast side of the Western Cemetery, has a complex modern history: since 1913, it has been divided between Egypt and the United States. While the mastaba core is still in the Western Cemetery, the offering-room (Room B) and the west wall of the forecourt (Room C, MFA 13.4352) are currently in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The offering-room has been in storage since its arrival at the MFA, while the entryway and the west wall of the forecourt were on display until late January 2020. The east wall of the forecourt, left in situ, has mostly disappeared (Room C). Room A, the original offering-room eventually transformed into a serdab, also remains in situ. 
       </p>
    <br>
    <p>But, why study this mastaba? Is it more interesting, or more significant, than the hundreds of others built right next to it? Well, yes! G 2184 was known to have been decorated with rare and unique scenes but had never been studied in depth—and never fully published. Moreover, the tomb had been exposed to the elements for over one hundred years, since its first excavation by George Reisner and the Harvard University-MFA expedition in 1912. In that period of time, the monument has deteriorated at a higher speed than it had in the approximately 4,000 years since its construction. Additionally, while not uncommon for archaeological studies of that time period, the excavation of the monument in 1912 lasted a mere four days. Though it was later again briefly worked on in 1975, when William Kelly Simpson and the Pyramids Project of the Pennsylvania-Yale Archaeological Expedition produced several line drawings of the mastaba’s decoration, it seemed to us quite likely that there was still a lot to learn from Akhmerutnisut’s resting place. Therefore, the Mastaba of Akhmerutnisut Documentation Project (MAD-P) embarked on its first fieldwork season in December 2023, funded by ARCE’s Antiquities Endowment Fund (AEF), with the kind permission of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.</p>
