    <h2>A Forgotten Tomb in Giza</h2>
    <p>When thinking about ancient Egypt, one invariably thinks about pyramids. And when thinking about pyramids, one invariably thinks about the Giza Plateau. But the Giza necropolis was much more than a royal cemetery, an impression that likely escapes visitors due to most people’s focus on the royal monuments. The well-known pyramids, in the past, would have been surrounded by hundreds of elite tombs: many of these tombs were free-standing complexes, so-called mastabas, while others were carved in the rocky escarpments of the plateau. The Giza Plateau would have been a vibrant landscape, brought to life with people, rituals, and ceremonies extending beyond the pyramids to those surrounding elite tombs.
        Giza’s elite tombs are much lesser-known than the pyramids. However, they are as important as the pyramids for our understanding of ancient Egyptian history.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Named after the tomb under study, the Mastaba of Akhmerutnisut Documentation Project (MAD-P) focuses on mastaba number G 2184, which belonged to the Fifth Dynasty official Akhmerutnisut. Akhmerutnisut’s mastaba, located on the northeast side of the Western Cemetery, has a complex modern history: since 1913, it has been divided between Egypt and the United States. While the mastaba core is still in the Western Cemetery, the offering-room (Room B) and the west wall of the forecourt (Room C, MFA 13.4352) are currently in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The offering-room has been in storage since its arrival at the MFA, while the entryway and the west wall of the forecourt were on display until late January 2020. The east wall of the forecourt, left in situ, has mostly disappeared (Room C). Room A, the original offering-room eventually transformed into a serdab, also remains in situ. 
       </p>
    <br>
    <p>But, why study this mastaba? Is it more interesting, or more significant, than the hundreds of others built right next to it? Well, yes! G 2184 was known to have been decorated with rare and unique scenes but had never been studied in depth—and never fully published. Moreover, the tomb had been exposed to the elements for over one hundred years, since its first excavation by George Reisner and the Harvard University-MFA expedition in 1912. In that period of time, the monument has deteriorated at a higher speed than it had in the approximately 4,000 years since its construction. Additionally, while not uncommon for archaeological studies of that time period, the excavation of the monument in 1912 lasted a mere four days. Though it was later again briefly worked on in 1975, when William Kelly Simpson and the Pyramids Project of the Pennsylvania-Yale Archaeological Expedition produced several line drawings of the mastaba’s decoration, it seemed to us quite likely that there was still a lot to learn from Akhmerutnisut’s resting place. Therefore, the Mastaba of Akhmerutnisut Documentation Project (MAD-P) embarked on its first fieldwork season in December 2023, funded by ARCE’s Antiquities Endowment Fund (AEF), with the kind permission of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.</p>

    <h4>2023 Season</h4>
    <p>The goal this season was to evaluate the current state of the monument and thoroughly document its architecture and remaining decoration. Almost immediately we found some bits of decoration — including a painted human figure, and a fragment of an inscription — that we did not expect because they had not been recorded by Reisner’s team. Those unexpected fragments of painting and inscription have the potential to help us better understand the different construction and decoration phases of the mastaba, leading us to consider whether this tomb may originally have belonged to the father of Akhmerutnisut, Kanefer. Besides studying the mastaba’s interior decoration, we also took great care to document the rest of the monument as thoroughly as possible. We started to produce a new plan, which, despite being unfinished, is already more detailed than the one produced by Reisner’s team in 1912. We measured all visible limestone blocks to keep track of differences in block sizes (which might help us to understand distinct construction phases), as well as differences in the state of the blocks (since some are more deteriorated than others).</p>
    <br>
    <p>At the end of the season, we took measures to protect the mastaba, including its remaining decoration and plaster flooring (Fig. 8). These temporary protective measures align with our future goals for MAD-P, which include consolidating and conserving the remaining decoration and architecture. To that end, Youssef and Yasser, the team’s conservators, have identified the structural weak points of the mastaba and drawn up a conservation plan. Ultimately, we hope to reconstruct parts of the tomb and, working alongside the Director of the Giza Archaeological Site and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, to increase awareness of the elite tombs of the Giza necropolis by opening the mastaba of Akhmerutnisut to the public. We are scheduled to conduct our second fieldwork season in early 2026, when we will start conserving the parts of the tomb that have been the most affected by deterioration and also start re-excavating the shafts and burial chambers of Akhmerutnisut and his family members.</p>
