        <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
        <p>We would like to express our gratitude to the members of the Permanent Committee of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, specifically to Mr. Sherif Fathy (Minister of Tourism and Antiquities), Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled (Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities), and Dr. Hany Abdallah Eltayeb (General Director of Foreign Missions Affairs and Permanent Committees), for permitting us to work at the site, as well as for their kind support.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Locally, our work benefited from the active interest of and very fruitful cooperation with Dr. Ashraf Mohie El-Din (Director of the Giza Archaeological Site), Dr. Tarek Barakat (Chief Inspector), and Dr. Mahmoud Abd El-Aleem (Director of the Western Field). We extend our deepest gratitude to all. Lastly, we thank Ms. Nareman Sayed for her continued assistance and graciousness in her capacity as inspector of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our work would not have been possible without the financial and logistical support of the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE), who generously funded our 2023 and 2026 fieldwork seasons through a grant from their Antiquities Endowment Fund. Finally, we would like to thank the Centre of the Humanities (CHAM) of NOVA University Lisbon for their institutional support.</p>
